## About Me

I live near Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I've been in software since I graduated with a Computer Science degree in 2006. I live with my wife and two kids who make up the best bits of life. I am a baseball nerd...I love everything about the sport (statistics, history, watching, playing, coaching). I also love to work with my hands when I get the chance...home renovations and woodworking are my usual outlets. I play guitar very poorly.

## What Motivates Me

My motivation over time has solidified into a fairly simple concept. I'm most motivated when I'm working with smart and passionate people toward a meaningful goal. The goal doesn't have to be world-changing, which has led me to believe I am more motivated by people and culture than by the work itself.

## What Demotivates Me

What demotivates me the most is the sense that myself or my colleagues have fallen into a state of going through the motions. Losing the spark for the work and the vibrance of the team.

## My Values (and what I value in others)

I value and respect doing the 'right thing'...most especially with disregard for personal accolades.
I value feedback...both giving and receving in a respectful and empathetic way. More importantly, I value a culture that embraces mult-directional honest feedback.

## Where am I?

My career has evolved over time (as they do). In the last five or so years, I've found myself embracing leadership. I'm excited by leading people in their careers as well as leading initiatives and units toward success. I've learned a lot about myself and others along the journey...and there's SO MUCH more for me to learn.

## Pet Peeves

- When people can't at least be willing to explore the grey areas of a topic. In my view, almost nothing is black or white...more like one of a million shades of grey.
- When you see a character in a TV show handling a cup of coffee...it's usually painfully obvious the cup is empty. I can't NOT see this anymore. Drives me crazy.
